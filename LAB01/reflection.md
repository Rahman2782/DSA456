# Reflection

## First Experience with Python
- While python functions in a similar way to C++, it is a higher level language and
as a result makes the code much more readable and smaller in comparison to C++. For
example, declaring variables in C++ requires you to specify the type of the variable. In
python I dont have to do that. The for loop is another example of a tool that is much more
simple in python in comparison to C++. If there is a list (same as an array in c++) I can simply
loop through it usign 'for x in list'.

- Dictionaries are new to me as c++ does not have an equivalent to this, or at least not one that 
I know of. The closest thing would be using parallel arrays, but this is just so much easier and simpler
to use. 

- Classes also behave slightly differently. To decalre class attributes in python, they have to be declared
using the __init__ function, and then all defined attributes have to be of the 'self' class (self can be any 
word). Class methods that use these attributes call them using self.counter, for example. In c++ you could just
say their name. Classes in python are the only thing that I find a little more confusing than c++ so far.

- The entire structure and flow of python behaves differently from what I expected, for example 
there are no semi-colons at all which was very off putting at first, each line is its own 
statement automatically. Furthermore not having brackets when declaring an if-statement or 
for-loop was very strange at first. These read more like a sentence then code now, if that
makes sense. Code blocks dont use curly braces {} and instead use a semi-colon, all blocks are in
indented sections rather than within brackets.

- Overall, python still has complex features like c++, but simplifies them a lot more so its easier to 
read and manage. Movig forwards I feel like python may slowly become my main language because of this.
