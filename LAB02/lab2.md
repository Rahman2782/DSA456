# Function 1
    def function1(number):
        total = 0
    
        for i in range(number):
            x = i + 1
            total += x * x
 
	return total
- **Time Complexity = O(n) - linear growth** 
- **Space Complexity = O(1) - constant** 

The loop runs 'number' amount of times and the operations within the loop are constant,
the variables declared in the function are also constant.


# Function 2
    def function2(number):
        return (number * (number + 1) * (2 * number + 1)) // 6
- **Time Complexity = O(1) - constant growth** 
- **Space Complexity = O(1) - constant** 

There is a fixed number of operations to be performed in the function and the input
(number) will not affect the time and space complexity as a result.


# Function 3
    def function3(list):
        n = len(list)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            for j in range(n - 1 - i):
                if list[j] > list[j+1]:
                    tmp = list[j]
                    list[j] = list[j+1]
                    list[j + 1] = tmp
- **Time Complexity = O(n^2) - quadratic growth** 
- **Space Complexity = O(1) - constant**

This function is a bubble sort, when there is a for loop nested in another for loop it 
creates a grid of 'n'(length of 'list'), this results in quadratic growth or O(n^2) growth.
'n' is affected by 'list' while tmp is constant  in this function.


# Function 4
    def function4(number):
        total = 1
        for i in range(1, number):
            total *= i + 1
        return total
- **Time Complexity = O(n) - liner growth** 
- **Space Complexity = O(1) - constant**

The loop will iterate 'number' times and each iteration performs constant operations with the
variables in the function all using a constant amount of space.
