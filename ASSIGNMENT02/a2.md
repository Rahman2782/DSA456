# A2 Time and Space Complexity Analysis

## Function: `__init__(self, front = None, back = None)`
- **Time Complexity: O(1)** - Creates two sentinel nodes and performs constant-time init. operations
- **Space Complexity: O(1)** - Allocates fixed memory for two sentinel nodes and instance variables

## Function: `insert(self, data)`
- **Time Complexity: O(n)** - May traverse the entire list to find the correct insertion position. The while loop runs up to 'n' times in the worst case
- **Space Complexity: O(1)** - Creates one new node and uses constant additional memory

## Function: `remove(self, data)`
- **Time Complexity: O(n)** - May traverse the entire list to find the data to remove. Early optimization but worst case is still linear
- **Space Complexity: O(1)** - Uses only local variables and constant additional memory

## Function: `is_present(self, data)`
- **Time Complexity: O(n)** - May go through the entire list. Includes early termination when encountering larger values due to its nature
- **Space Complexity: O(1)** - Uses only local variables for travel

## Function: `__len__(self)`
- **Time Complexity: O(1)** - Just returns the stored size attribute
- **Space Complexity: O(1)** - Accesses existing variable without additional memory allocation
